I'd like to show my vision on contemporary clothing. It can be inspired by fairy tales, history and folklore and still be functional and comfortable.

I like simplicity and functionality, but I also like symbolism and cultural references. It's much more powerful to wear a piece of clothing that has a story behind it. I believe in power clothes. Kind of armour and amulet we wear. 

Hello! I'm Katia from Barcelona. Very often I can't find clothes for myself in shops, but I always imagine what I need. That's why I started sewing my own clothes.

Here I will be sharing my process and inspiration. And if you like my style, let me know with your kind comments and likes ‚ù§

My vision of contemporary clothing is inspired by fairy tales, history and folklore. Yet it's functional and comfortable.
