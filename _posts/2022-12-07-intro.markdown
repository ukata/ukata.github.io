My name is Katia. Welcome and please feel comfortable, cause this blog is about cozy clothing.

I often cannot find clothes in shops, but I always imagine what I want. That's why I started crafting my own clothes. My style has little to do with contemporary fashion, it’s based on traditional folk costume, with a little bit of magic and sparkles of fantasy ✨

Here I will be sharing my process and inspiration. And if you like my style, let me know with your kind comments ❤
