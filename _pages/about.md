Hello! I am Katia from Minsk, currently based in Barcelona.

I am a lifelong creative, having been involved in traditional painting, mural art, architecture, photography, digital art, and UI design.

At the same time, I always had a passion for handcraft. I practiced embroidery, jewelry design, and fashion design yet on the level of a hobby. But now I decided to realize my dream of creating clothes on a professional level.

As a teenager, I liked redesigning my clothes and later learned to sew some original pieces for myself. Probably, I have inherited the passion for DIY from my parents. It was common in my family to create clothes, home decorations, pieces of furniture, and even build a house. For this creativity, I am very grateful.

During the last year, I created several items of clothes that I designed myself. Here I am presenting the story of my process. And hopefully, it will help me gradually transform this activity into a profitable brand. A unique and beautiful brand we can all enjoy.
