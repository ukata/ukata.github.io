Hello! I'm Katia from Minsk, currently based in Barcelona.

I’m a lifelong creative, having been involved in traditional painting, mural art, architecture, photography, digital art and UI design.

At the same time I always had a passion for handcraft. I practised embroidery, jewellery design, fashion design, yet on the level of a hobby. But now I decided to realise my dream of creating clothes on a professional level.

As a teenager I liked to redesign my clothes, and later learned how to sew some original pieces for myself. Probably I have inherited my passion for DIY from my parents. It was common in my family to create clothes, home decoration, pieces of furniture and even building a house. For this creativity I’m very grateful.

During the last year I created several items of clothes which I designed myself. Here I'm presenting the story of my process. And hopefully it will help me gradually transform this activity into a profitable brand. A unique and beautiful brand we can all enjoy.
